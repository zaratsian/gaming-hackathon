# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è NPC Agent Hackathon with ADK

## üéØ Purpose

Get ready to dive into the world of AI agents with the Google Cloud Agent Development Kit (ADK). This fun, informal hackathon will give you hands-on experience using the ADK to design and orchestrate a complex, multi-agent system in a single session.

You‚Äôll build your own NPC agent for a fantasy world using the provided starter repo and creative MCP server endpoints. The goal is to explore how agents can interact with APIs and bring characters to life through fun, unexpected behaviors.

You can use this starter code as a simple example to get you up and running, but your goal is to personalize it based on your NPC and specific use cases goals.

### What You'll Learn

* ADK Fundamentals: Get hands-on with the core libraries, setup, and deployment processes.

* Multi-Agent Architecture: Understand how to define, connect, and orchestrate specialized agents to solve problems.

* Core ADK Features: Explore tool-use, inter-agent communication, potentially memory management, agent sessions, MCP and more depending on your agent goals.


## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Starter Repo**: This repository contains a simple NPC skeleton (`starter_agent/agent.py`) with placeholders to customize.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zaratsian/gaming-hackathon.git
    cd gaming-hackathon
    ```

2.  **Run Setup Script**:

    ```bash
    python setup.py
    ```

3.  **Launch Developer UI**: After setup, you can launch the developer UI to test your agent, inspect tools, requests, responses, and states.

    ```bash
    adk web
    ```
    This will typically open in your browser at `localhost:8000`.

4.  **NPC Design**: What do you want your NPC to do? Examples: Trickster Goblin, Weather Sage, Traveling Merchant, Cardmaster.

5.  **Add Personality & Logic**: Update the prompts for your agent(s), add more agents, use the provided functions, and/or create your own responses.

6.  **Use Creative Endpoints**: Call APIs to give your NPC special powers. You can integrate external APIs or create your own MCP server endpoints.

    *   Jokes & Riddles
    *   Deck of Cards & Dice Rolls
    *   Weather Forecasts
    *   Google Maps Lookups
    *   Trivia & Story Prompts

## Stretch Goals

*   Chain multiple endpoints together for more dynamic responses (e.g., give a riddle, then reward with a card draw).
*   Add memory or state variables so your NPC remembers past interactions or certain information.
*   Integrate with MCP servers.
*   Collaborate with others to link NPCs together into a shared storyline. (Agent2Agent)

## Project Structure

Your agent project should follow this structure:

```
parent_folder/
    starter_agent/
        __init__.py
        agent.py
        tools.py
        .env (optional, but this file is generated after running setup.py)
```

*   `__init__.py`:
    ```python
    from . import agent
    ```
*   `agent.py`: Defines your main agent and any sub-agents.
*   `tools.py`: Contains the functions (tools) that your agents can use.
